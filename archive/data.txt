Tier #1 or Tier #2
To be considered Tier 1 the property must meet the all of the following:
1)	Be under 75’ from the lowest point of fire department access to the floor of the top occupied floor (ie, not a high-rise as defined by Marriott in our design standards).
2)	Be under 250 guestrooms, inclusive of the whole building (ie, co-branded properties which have over 250 rooms total but under 250 individually do not fall under Tier 1).
3)	Under 25,000 square feet of meeting space
4)	Defined as Tier 2 by Marriott FLS for another reason.

Each month when the projects go to committee for approval and get approved, FLS will go through the approvals and place the projects in Tier 1 or Tier 2, and then notify all Tier 1 properties that they will need to decide which route they will go.  Of the properties who decide to opt into the self-certification Marriott will audit 20% prior to opening and trainer release, thus any issues encountered could cause delays in opening.

For properties who opt to go with the third-party certification, we will need the following:

1)	Signed selection form with the name and contact info for the: 
a.	The architect of record who will be signing off on the design and signing of that the design meets Marriott’s design standards.
b.	The Owners third-party licensed fire protection engineer, licensed engineer of record, or fire and life safety consultant who will be signing off at project closeout that all system have been tested and meet Marriott’s design standards
2)	At the completion of the construction documents we will need the signed design certification from the AOR. (certification located in franchise agreement)
3)	At project closeout prior to trainer release we will need the signed certification from the Owners third-party licensed fire protection engineer, licensed engineer, or fire and life safety consultant that systems have been tested and meet Marriott’s design standards. (certification located in franchise agreement)

If the owner decides to use Marriott’s services the $7,500 fee includes:

1.	Thirty Percent (30%) Design Document Drawings.  Marriott will conduct a review of the thirty percent (30%) complete design document drawings.  Such review will include a review of the architectural, fire alarm system and fire suppression drawings, including shop drawings, if available. Upon review, Marriott will provide a letter to Owner summarizing the fire protection and life safety related issues observed during this review, with comments for each discipline and the applicable code references. A copy of the letter will be provided to the Marriott International Design & Construction Services, Inc. (“Marriott Design & Construction”) Project Manager, and the Marriott Design & Construction Design Manager.

2.	Shop Drawings, Cut Sheets and Calculation (Battery and Hydraulic) Documents. Marriott will perform a review of the Fire Alarm and Sprinkler Shop Drawings, Cut Sheets, and Calculation (battery and hydraulic) Documents limited to such documents’ compliance with applicable codes and the Life Safety Design Standard. Upon review, Marriott will provide a letter to Owner summarizing the fire protection and life safety related issues related to the Fire Alarm and Sprinkler Shop Drawings, Cut Sheets, and Calculation (battery and hydraulic) Documents.  A copy of the letter will be provided to the Marriott Design & Construction Project Manager.

3.	Ninety Percent (90%) Design Document Drawings.  Marriott will perform a review of the ninety percent (90%) complete design documents limited to such documents’ compliance with applicable codes and the Life Safety Design Standard.  This review will include a review of the architectural, fire alarm system, and fire suppression system comments from the thirty percent (30%) phase, and shop drawings, if available. Upon review, Marriott will provide a letter to Owner summarizing the fire protection and life safety related issues related to the Ninety Percent (90%) Construction Document Drawings.
